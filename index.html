        <p>My hobby is reading books .Whenever I gets free time, I read books and I enjoy it.  My teacher always tells us that reading is very important for children as we gain lot of knowledge through it. My parents also buys books for me and now there is a small library in my home. There are lots of books about freedom fighters, warriors, kings,  etc, available there. Last time when I won the school proficiency, my aunt gifted me a full collection of Sherlock Holmes. My favorite books are Mahabharata and 5001 fantastic facts. Reading also helps me to gain confidence and  prepare for  school quiz competitions.</p>
